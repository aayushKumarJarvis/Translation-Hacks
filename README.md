Translation-Hacks
=================

Unofficial PHP Web Clients to perform translations

These are three translation clients built to perform some useful dev operations. My use case was to build a hash map of a billion translations
from English to Japanese using Redis Key Value Store. 

However, its easy to write such clients, the only pain point is to Parse the response fetched. 

I have included here two clients respectively : 

1. Google Translate
2. Bing Translate
